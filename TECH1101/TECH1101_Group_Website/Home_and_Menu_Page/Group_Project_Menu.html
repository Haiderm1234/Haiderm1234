						<hr>
						<h1>Dandy in the Underword</h1>
						<p>5.5% ABV</p>

						<p>
							This farmhouse ale is available year round in the bottle and draught. A table strength beer brewed with rye and french saison yeast. IS is light, refreshing,

						<hr>

						<h1>The Dandy Wild Sour Ale</h1>
						<p>7.3% ABV</p>
						<p>
							A bold, malty sour ale soured with lactobacillus and fermented with a yeast strain. An upfront sourness is balanced with wild yeast character for a rich 
							sour experience.

						<hr>

						<h1>The Golden Brown Dandy</h1>
						<p>6% ABV</p>
						<p>

					<h1>In the Bleak Midwinter: Black IPA</h1>
					<p>6.5% ABV</p>
					<p>Winter</p>
					<p>

					<h1>The Jungle Bird: Tropical Dark Sour</h1>
					<p>5% ABV</p>
					<p>Spring</p>
					<p>
						An homage to the classic Tiki cocktail. This beer has notes of demerara sugar, bitter lime, tropical pineapple coming together

					<hr>

					<h1>Bright Young Things: Hopped Wheat Ale</h1>
					<p>5.5% ABV</p>
					<p>Summer</p>
					<p>
						English Summer Ale. A style developed during the late 70's heat wave in England, this beer is designed to refresh in the hot summer sun. 
						Dry, with a touch of wheat and toasted Victory malt, it is balanced with a touch of bitterness and a sweet citrus aroma. 
						Patios, BBQ's, and friends all pair perfectly with this beer!
