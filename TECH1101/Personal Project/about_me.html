            This marks the beginning of my development journey.
            I will be creating many products going further.
            Hopefully this fun and exciting journey leads to much
            success and a lot of new inventions. I hope to help
            as many people's lives as I can with my inventions.

                This is my first official website that I can say Im proud of.
                I have made a ton of pages in html and used css to edit before,<br>
                but while doing this project I got to explore js side of website
                development. I am fascinated by the posibilities of creativity <br>
                in this field and intend to indulge further in this even after 
                handing this project in.
